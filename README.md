# Scientific Calculator Android Application
A scientific calculator app for Android. Which comes with good user interface. The app will be a basic calculator in potrait mode. To enable
the scientific mode in the calculator you need to turn on your "Orientation/Rotation" in your mobile. And rotate the phone landscape. The
scientific mode is only available in landscape mode. You can perform functions like SIN, COS, TAN, ABS, Floor, LOG, LN, Pie, Square root, Cube Root,
exponential and more. You also can perform "BODMAS" / "PEDMAS" in this calculator application. I did the entire User Interface in dark theme
to make it look cool and minimal. The entire project is coded in JAVA. Thanks for your time. Hope you like it ðŸ™‚
